We will have lots of fun and enjoy the escarpment and beautiful scenery. Make sure to drag along the members of your family. The more the merrier so come many. We are planning to leave on 23rd so make sure to be at our place by 8 am. We will travel by vehicle so that we enjoy the great scenery while on the road. We are eagerly waiting for you guys so make sure not to miss out. Yours lovingly, Winnie"

As for the promenades, it is good because we have just restarted certain special meals of restaurants in the cobbled road. I propose to you to discover them so that you can absorb a bit of yesteryear atmosphere. Later, we can climb up to the top of the arc de Triomphe (monument). There are hundreds of steps to climb but we could discover one of the most beautiful points of view on Montpellier. If the weather is not good (which would be surprising), we have decided to take you to the FAVRE museum. It is one of the most important museums in France. It possesses beautiful collections with which you can entertain yourself. For the evening, I have reserved tickets for evenings. The first, it is a concert of EMILIE SIMON; she has recently won a prize for the original track of film ‘The march of emperor’. The second will be more classical. We will go to see a dance spectacle by 3 dancers and I already know that you will be charmed. For the last evening, if it pleases you, we will spend the entire at drama theatre. We will watch 3 dramas of MOLIERE. You will also get to taste the grated soup and the red wines. Martin thinks that you will not regret it. We are impatient to meet you. See you in two weeks."

I still remember the first day of school when we were young, you called me and gave a seat beside you. It’s now almost 15 years and our relationship has grown in past years. I would like to thank you for being there for me for the ups and downs of my life. Last year when my father passed away you were a support to me and my family. I don’t know what I would have done without you then. You were more helpful than my relatives. I can never forget how you stayed back in the hospital late night just to support me and my mother. I cherish every moment of life we spent together. Though you are away from me I still feel that you are close to me. How are your studies going? Last time when you wrote you seemed little worried about the portions. I know you will easily pass your engineering also with flying colors. When are your next holidays? I am eagerly waiting to meet you and spend some good time together. I would like to thank you for being my friend and being there for me. With best wishes, Elizabeth"

If you are around, I don’t think anyone in the room will be sad but leave the room with a smile on their face. You are one person who does not fail to me make laugh. I forget all my worries when I am without, and I am incredibly lucky to have you by my side, my Friend! You are a person who can make anyone smile, and I must say you are our stress buster. Someone like you can make the dead end situations lights, the moments of doubt simpler. Your humor is not the only thing that I like about you but you are a gem of a person and I know I can rely on you. Be the same always! Give my love to your mom and dad and loads of love to you too. Stay in touch and do write! Take care."
